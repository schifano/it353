(c) [14 pts] For email, the two criteria for valid format are as follows. (i) First, make sure there is only one @ sign and that it is not at the beginning or end of the address. (ii) Second, ensure that there is at least one period that appears after the @ sign (but not immediately after) in the address and any periods are not at the beginning or end of the address. Note that it is OK to have a period anywhere before the @ sign for the purpose of this question. 

(e) [5 pts] If the above format is not followed, give appropriate alert responses (e.g., "period cannot appear immediately after @"; no generic messages!) and abort the submit process. Do not go through the rest of the validations if one is found to violate the rules. Otherwise, go through with the submission. The submission should be made to the EchoAll servlet given in Question 1.

Some possible test cases (not exhaustive! The ones in bold are valid, including the last one!):
 Zip Code: “1234”, “1234a”, “12345” and “12345b1234” and “12345-1234”

"email", "@email", "email@domain", "email@domain@com", "email.address@domain.x", "email@domain." "email@domain.com", "email@.domain", ".email@domain.com", "email@domain.", "emaildomain@", "email@.domain.com", "email@domain.com.cn", "email.@domain.com"

A partial solution that brings together some of the pieces is given in my2ndJSValidation.html. Feel free to take advantage of the base line code. Note that it does NOT handle all the requirements. You need to add your own work! Also, try applying the CSS file form.css (from Google code university) to the page my2ndJSValidation.html and see the effects.

Include screenshots that show the output of code. Since this question requires the testing many different scenarios, you are asked to simply submit 10 screenshots, namely 2 per form element, showing an invalid entry and a valid entry. You should nevertheless test all the scenarios!
