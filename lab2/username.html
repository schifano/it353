<!-- [10 pts] Write a JavaScript program to display a label and a text field for username (this is part of a new user sign up page). As the user types the (new) username, your program should display whether the username is taken or not, using the onkeyup event handler. Instead of checking the usernames on a server (with AJAX), you are to simply hardcode the list of usernames in your JS code. Use the list of {"aaa111","bbb222","ccc333"} for names taken. Namely, if any of the 3 is typed, say "username already taken."

Use the sample given in http://www.itk.ilstu.edu/faculty/bllim/itk353/inlineValidStrengthTests.html as the base for your solution.-->
<!doctype html>
<head>
	<title>Username Check</title>
	<script>
	function checkUsername(aName) {
		var currentName = aName.value;
		var names = ["aaa111","bbb222","ccc333"];
		var tempName;
		var i;
		for (i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
			tempName = names[i];
			if (tempName == currentName) {
				alert("Username already taken.");
				return -1;
			}
		}
	}
	</script>
</head>
<body>
	<form name="myForm">
		Username: <input type="text" id="username" onkeyup="checkUsername(this)">
	</form>
</body>
