<!-- [10 pts] Assume that you have a form that contains a set of radio button objects. If the number of radio objects is small (e.g., just Male and Female for the Gender radio object), then it is feasible to setup an if condition that does the test (like you did in Assignment #1). But if the number of choices is huge, say 10 or above, then the compound if condition might be too big.

Your job is to write a segment of JavaScript code that will detect which radio button is selected (if any) and display the selection. Specifically, create a group of 7 radio objects (just label them with names, say the Seven Wonders of the World) and a button object. Then, upon clicking the button, display an alert window to show the selection in number (0 for the 1st one, 1 for the 2nd one, etc.) You are encouraged to use the value attribute. If no selection is made, be sure to indicate "No selection given!". -->
