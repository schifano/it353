Review questions:

What is the purpose of using the NumberFormat class in the app?
What data structure is used to model a shopping cart and what is the initial capacity of this data structure?
When a shopping cart reaches its initial capacity, what happens?
Explain in plain English how the data structure "stretches" to accommodate more items if/when it reaches the initial capacity.
Identify all the static methods used in the app.
If the ShoppingCart constructor was changed in the following manner, what would happen? Briefly explain.

public ShoppingCart() { 
   capacity = 3; 
   itemCount = 0; 
   totalPrice = 0.0; 
   Item[] cart = new Item[capacity]; 
} 

Briefly describe the purpose of using an "interface" in Java.
Assume that the Item class above implements an interface called "Discountable," which has the method signature 

public double discount(); // this method tells the amount of discount to give (0.10 means 10% discount)

What changes must be made to the item class? Make up a simple logic for the discount method.
Assume that Item class indeed implements Discountable (a la question 8 above), does the following method compile and run properly? Briefly explain.

public void addToCart(String itemName, double price, int quantity) { 
   Item anItem = new Item(itemName, price, quantity); 
   cart[itemCount++] = anItem; 
   totalPrice += price * (1 - anItem.discount()) * quantity; 
   if (itemCount == capacity) { increaseSize(); } 
}
 
Assume that Item class indeed implements Discountable (a la question 8 above), does the following statements compile and run properly? Briefly explain.

Discountable item = new Item(itemName, price, quantity); 
if (item.discount() > 0.20) 
    System.out.println("...");
