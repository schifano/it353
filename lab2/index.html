<ol>
	<li>No, I did not take any programming related courses in high school. I was focusing on taking honors and AP courses, and I refused to give up orchestra. I never really heard about programming courses, though I was interested in computers.</li>
	<li>STEM curriculums touch on a range of topics that typically break out of traditional lecture and focus on collaborative real-world problem solving. The students would use resources, such as Codecademy, to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript at their own pace in order to be exposed to object-oriented and front-end design. There would also be a maker module where the students focus on the hands-on building aspect of technology. The students would work on a cumulative project where they collect and interpret data. Using their new programming and real-world knowledge, they would be asked to work with code given to them that is more advanced so that they must break down the code to pieces they understand and modify it to fit their data visualization needs. These skills would prepare them for a job at a real corporation.</li>
